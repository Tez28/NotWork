## Description

NotWork is the second of three projects required by Vanderbilt University's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp for graduation. This project was created by a team of up-and-coming developers, comprised of: <a href="https://github.com/Tez28" target="_blank">Tez Cannady</a>, Jake George, <a href="https://github.com/wlowrimore" target="_blank">William Lowrimore</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/DrewSpeed" target="_blank">Drew Speed</a>. NotWork is a "one-stop-shop" for your IT Equipment fixes. Users who sign up can access and contribute to a database of common fixes for networking equipment. The team feels that with essentially every company having an IT department, and/or IT equipment, there is a need for an application that can be accessed to help, even the most "non-IT" individual, find expert help. As a Network Engineer, one may need to find a fix for their network equipment. This application allows the engineer to search a database by equipment names and providers, returning optional fixes to their troubleshooting problems. This type of information (in a blog-style environment) provides an "Engineers helping Engineers" platform, thus expediting the "fix' for any issues that may be inhibiting SLAs to clients.
